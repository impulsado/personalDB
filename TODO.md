Priority tasks --> Required changes to be made for next update.
Future features --> Ideas for future implementation that need research or time. 
Known bugs --> Identified bugs that do not affect the user experience too much (they can continue using the application without any problem).
Less important changes --> Minor changes that are usually related to the application UI.
Canceled tasks --> Tasks that have been considered in some of the previous categories that for some reason have been cancelled. The reason for the cancellation must be specified.
```

```Task attributes
@username --> Name of the user who is working on the task.
dd-MM-YYYY --> Date of the day the task is assigned.
